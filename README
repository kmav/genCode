GenCode provides automatic code generation from UML model. The code
generation is based on class and sequence diagrams. Present version generates
conventional Java code or Java-Android code. To generate code for the Android
platform, the user should indicate the use of Android components (like Activity,
Intent and Services) into the model.

This is an academic efforts developed at the Federal University of Pelotas in
Brazil and its evolution can be observed in the publications bellow.
