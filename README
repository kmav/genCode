GenCode is a code generator, which automatically generates code from UML model 
composed by class and sequence diagrams. Current version generates conventional 
Java code, Java-Android code, or yet C# code. 

The last GenCode extensions have focused on automating the mobile application 
development, targeting the Android and Windows Phone platforms.
To generate code for the mobile applications, the user should indicate the use 
of specific platform components (like Activity, Intent and Services in Android, 
or yet PhoneApplicationPage in WP) into the model.  

This is an academic efforts developed at the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil 
and its evolution can be observed in the publications bellow.  For more information
